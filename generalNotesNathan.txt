  Working on question class (question2.py currently)

  - I don't think we need getters and setters for the question class since you can just use 
  dot (.) notation on the object to access its attributes.

  - I think displayQuestion() should be part of the UI logic, not the question class, so 
  I left it out

  - I didn't have image attributes or methods since we are not working with images

  - I also think calculateScore() should be part of the game or level class, not the 
  question class


Working on player class (Player.py)

  - I made moveToNextLevel class to take a parameter of level, just so we can explicitly state what
  the next level is, instead of just calling it with no parameters.

  Working on finalizing game & tutorial & mainmenu classes (Game.py & Tutorial.py & MainMenu.py) - Michael
  Working on boss & level classes (Boss.py & Level.py) - Harjab
  Working on UserAccount, instructor and debugger - Nathan

  - Creating the player bank JSON file. 

  - for the scoring, I read in the req. docs that we are scoring by
  total weight of questions got right by far MINUS total weight of questions got wrong by far PLUS 
  player's HP remaining by far.

      wouldn't that make your score always 0 unless you win the game? Are we not giving a player a 
      score even if they lose the game. 

      I think we should make the scoring system based on the weight of the questions that were gotten
      right, multiplied by some factor of the remaining HP. LMK what you guys think.

Working on question class (question2.py currently)

- I don't think we need getters and setters for the question class since you can just use 
dot (.) notation on the object to access its attributes.

- I think displayQuestion() should be part of the UI logic, not the question class, so 
I left it out

- I didn't have image attributes or methods since we are not working with images

- I also think calculateScore() should be part of the game or level class, not the 
question class


Working on player class (Player.py)

- I made moveToNextLevel class to take a parameter of level, just so we can explicitly state what
the next level is, instead of just calling it with no parameters.
